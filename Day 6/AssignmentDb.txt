// differece between rdbms and non relational dbms(BENEFITS ALSO)


1. Relational Database : 
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. It is most popular database. In it, data is store in the form of row that is in the form of tuple. It contain numbers of table and data can be easily accessed because data is store in the table. This Model was proposed by E.F. Codd. 

2. NoSQL : 
NoSQL Database stands for a non-SQL database. NoSQL database doesnâ€™t use table to store the data like relational database. It is used for storing and fetching the data in database and generally used to store the large amount of data. It supports query language and provides better performance.

Relational Databases (RDBMS) Benefits

Data Integrity: High data integrity through enforcement of constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique indexes.

Strong Consistency: ACID-compliant transactions ensure reliable, consistent, and accurate data handling.

Structured Data: Best suited for structured data in well-defined tables with rows and columns.

Complex Queries: Excellent support for complex queries, joins, and data relationships using SQL.

Standardized Query Language: SQL is a widely adopted and standardized query language, making it easy to use across different RDBMS platforms.

Relationships Between Data: Strong support for data relationships through foreign keys and normalization.

Flexibility: Schema-less design allows for storing varied and evolving data models without the need for migrations.

Scalability: Horizontal scaling enables nearly unlimited growth by adding more servers, making it ideal for handling massive amounts of data.

High Performance: Optimized for fast read/write operations, especially in real-time and high-volume applications.

Unstructured Data Support: Best suited for unstructured or semi-structured data like JSON, XML, and multimedia files.

Eventual Consistency: BASE compliance ensures better availability and fault tolerance, allowing for relaxed consistency when necessary.

Variety of Data Models: Supports different data models such as document-based, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases, offering flexibility based on use case.

//major terms of a database

Primary Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table that ensures each row is distinct.

Foreign Key: A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two.

Constraints: Rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK).

Index: A performance optimization feature that allows faster retrieval of records from a table.

Unique Key: A constraint that ensures all values in a column are distinct but allows a single NULL value.

Not Null: A constraint that ensures a column cannot have NULL values.

Default: A value automatically assigned to a column when no explicit value is provided.

Composite Key: A primary key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely identify a record.

Auto Increment: A feature that automatically generates a unique number for each new record in a column.

Join: An operation that combines records from two or more tables based on a related column.

Stored Procedure: A precompiled SQL code that can be executed to perform a specific task, improving performance and reusability.

View: A virtual table created by a query that presents data from one or more underlying tables.

Trigger: A database operation automatically executed in response to certain events, such as updates or inserts.
